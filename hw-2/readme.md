## Assignment 1: Git Readme


### Blog Topic Summary

My cat is "All About Cats" where you can find anything and everything you need to know about cats. I chose this topic because I'm a crazy cat lady at heart. I have 3 cats of my own, and as a college student living not at home, I miss them dearly every single day.

### Key Takeaways

Websites with hero images seem to be structured very nicely. I almost put the nav above the hero image, but I put it below to draw the users down to the main content of the page. I remember doing a lot of similar stuff in Todd's class, but it's been a while, so I had to look a couple of things up such as placing text over a hero image in order to get my desired outcome.

When following the flex and grid stuff in class, it seemed easy enough, but when implementing my own grid with different styling, I had to go back and reference the labs and mess around with the variables to get things to look how I wanted. 

For the declawing page, I really wanted to use like a pop-up alert or something. My TA in Todd's class taught us how to do it but I cannot remember how to do it or what its called or if it's javascript or just html. So I ended up just making a button.

tldr; grids still hurt my brain, specifically the grid-template stuff and I'd like to thank my labs for helping me get through it.
